							<h3>Ventura Medical Technologies</h3>
							<p><i>Engineering Intern</i></p>
							<div class="row">									
								<ul>
									<li>Enhanced Python code in Jupyter Notebook that analyzed Digital Imaging and Communications
										in Medicine (DICOM) files to characterize a patientâ€™s Pectus Excavatum and generated 
										reports with patient specific recommendations for surgeons guiding Pectus Up implant 
										placement. Developed Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR) and multi-location sternal density scan tools.</li>
									<li>Analyzed 20+ CT scans using RadiAnt software, creating patient specific reports with sternal 
										measurements recommendations and additional notes for surgeons placing the Pectus Up implant.</li>
									<li>Researched and synthesized data to provide redesign recommendations for the Lantitaps device 
										prototype, proposing higher voltage batteries and fluid pumps with greater flow rate and pressure 
										capabilities to meet desired specifications. </li>
									<li>Developed content for a patient brochure for the Pectus Up surgical kit and implant, relaying 
										information about the implant, pre, during, and post-procedure guidelines.</li>
									<li>Updated Ventura Medical Technologies Pectus Up patient database and communicated with device 
										distributors to promptly obtain Pectus Up surgery information to ensure compliance with European 
										Medical Device Regulation (MDR).</li>
										
								</ul>
